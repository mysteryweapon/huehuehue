# huehuehue
Just a project to mess around with hue bulbs


You'll have to edit the huerc.py to add 2 things:
   hue_bridge: ip or hostname of your hue bridge
   api_key: you api key to interact with your hue bridge

If you are unfamiliar with how to get an api key, check out the philips hue api key doc here:

Special thanks to Ad Dijkhoff, a guy I met at re:invent in 2017 that 
essentially convinced me to make the initial investment in hue bulbs. 

It's been a wild ride
